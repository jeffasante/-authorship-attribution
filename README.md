Authorship attribution in tweeting.

## Stylometry
Stylometry is the application of the study of linguistic style, usually to written language, but it has been applied successfully to music and to fine-art paintings as well. Another conceptualization defines **it as the linguistic discipline that evaluates an author's style through the application of statistical analysis to a body of their work**.

Stylometry is often used to attribute authorship to anonymous or disputed documents. It has legal as well as academic and literary applications, ranging from the question of the authorship of Shakespeare's works to forensic linguistics.
